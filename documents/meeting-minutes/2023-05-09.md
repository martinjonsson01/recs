## Before the meeting
* Read through thesis and leave comments
* Mark comments according to comment categories

## Agenda
* Around the table
* Go through thesis
  * First EGRPs with entire group
  * Then, split into two groups and go through SLATs and NITs
* Yehia's Wise Words
  * Section 2.1 “Related Works” has now been reworked to eliminate the overlap with the introduction
    * Move it to a later part where benchmarks are introduced
  * Section 3.1 “Choice of Programming Language and its Features” has now been reworked to make it more clear which exact features we make use of
    * Try to be uniform, either comment shortly on all of them or remove the mentions
    * We mention three reasons but only elaborate on one(?)
    * Look over section 3.1 again with this in mind
    * He expects that we discuss everything one by one if we mention them at the same time. 
  * New structure of results (Chapters 4, 5 and 6)
    * Is nice:)
    * Good to keep it consistent, that each engine benchmarked have the same colour in every graph
        * Unity ECS Windows is pink in figure 5.2 and Recs is pink in 5.1
    * Add stats about the computer that performed the benchmarks
    * Change numbering of the figures to be according to subsection numberings
  * Section 4.2.1 “N-Body Simulation” describes one of our case studies. We’re also wondering if it’s redundant to derive the formulas like we’re currently doing?
    * Skip the equations, they're fundamental in this context. Try to explain the systems without them. 
  * The paragraph in results which talks about figure 6.3 has now been updated to include an explanation of “makespan”
    * it is nice now:)
    * Scheduler have a bug?? It doesn't preserve the order of information, can it happen that the systems order will be executed in such a way that the component information is updated in the wrong order? Schedule reordering would violate data integrity!
    * Look over the paragraph for the scheduler to clarify
  * The figures in section 6.1 have been reworked to be much more clearer
    * Nice? To be decided
  * Section 6.2 “Data Storage”
  * Section 7.1 “System Scheduler”, specifically the paragraph which begins with "The initial schedule generation may result in what users " and below. (The paragraphs above are WIP)
  * If they have been added, check out the graphs of the benchmark results in section 5 Benchmarks
  * Table of contents
    * Look over the parts of the thesis with the help of TOC, try to minimize redundancy
    * Look over how the TOC to see how the story unfolds
* Timeline
  * (**in 2 days**) 11/5 Fackspråk-supervision about presentation and film
  * (**in 3 days**) 12/5 Internal deadline
    * *Everything* should be finished by Friday. 
  * (**in 6 days**) 15/5 Thesis deadline "Sammanställd slutrapport"
    * Conclusion and abstract, feedback from supervisor and fill out results with benchmarks etc
  * (**in 7 days**) 16/5 Contribution Report due date
    * Everyone should have filled out their own parts of the [Contribution Report](/L4RI0rM1STaejiVBN2n4CA)
  * (**in 8 days**) 17/5 Film
    * Might do it earlier, or start preparing earlier, but at the latest it will be done during the two days between finished report and film due date
  * (**in 13 days**) 22/5 Written individual opposition
  * (**in 16-17 days**) 25-26/5 Final presentation & Opposition
    * Create the presentation during this week
    * Much can be reused from the film and thesis
    * Simultaneously, the opposition will be prepared

## Decisions
