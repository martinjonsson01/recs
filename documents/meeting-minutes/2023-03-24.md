# 2023-03-24 Meeting minutes
###### tags: `Meeting`
**13:00 | EG-3507**

Present: Martin, Mathias, Jacob, Christoffer, Linn, Edvin

## Before the meeting
* Everyone should have created issues in `New`
* Everyone should have thought about other possible case studies

## Agenda
* Around the table
  * Martin: Rättat tentor, läskigt och intressant att bli anförtrodd den uppgiften
  * Christoffer: Diablo 4 kommer idag, letsgooo
  * Jacob: Måndagsbreakthrough förr igenom:( Men nu är det nya äventyr
  * Edvin: Review master
  * Mathias: Writing master
  * Linn: Avslutat DAG aspningen, nu säger hon goNATT!
* Reminder: close issues at the same time you place them in `Done`!
* Move Monday meetings to Tuesdays 09:00-12:00 instead?
  * Except next monday, due to mastermässan, need to notify Yehia of this
  * Next week we go with monday at 10:00-12:00
  * After that it's tuesday 09:00-12:00
* Pull Requests
  * Priority of work [at beginning of a new "work-session", you]:
    1. Review others' PRs (to make sure you're not blocking others)
    2. Fix feedback/reply to comments on own PR (so it can be merged ASAP)
    3. Work on your currently self-assigned issue(s)
    4. Take a new issue from the backlog
  * How we handle reviews
    * Don't forget our [Git Workflow](/sk-Aj6CfRmSc_4AAS1bPQw)!
    * PR description should contain a short summary sentence, an image/gif (if applicable) and an example/explanation of what has been added
    * Example
    * Even if you feel like you might not have anything to add -- review it anyways!
      * Any fresh set of eyes on the code can and will notice things the author did not
    * Reviewers leave comments
      * Could be questions about how things work, (constructive) critique or praise
        * Don't say something is bad without motivating why and also suggesting a better way
      * If comments are non-critical and can be skipped, they accept the PR immediately
        * nitpicks are prefixed with `nit:` to make it clear to the PR author that they're not major problems
      * If comments are important and have to be resolved, they request changes
    * PR author resolves comments
  * Splitting into tasks
    * Suggestion: whoever is working on an issue has the responsibility of splitting it up into tasks if necessary, to reduce the burden for reviewers
      * Just like [#36](https://github.com/martinjonsson01/recs/issues/36) 
      * One downside: takes a while before merged into `master` -- to fix this maybe merge each task into `master` instead of feature branch?
* [Engine-writing Guidelines](/YJIbVCESQB6BmSUmJZiufg)
* Come up with more case studies
  * Should be simple to implement (i.e. implement existing algorithm)
  * At least one that is well-suited for parallelism
    * Rain simulation
      * Simple, about four or five systems
      * Many entities, how many can we have?
    * Is n-body well-suited or not?
      * Acceleration is the hard part, can it be done concurrently?
      * Easily becomes complex when many entities are in action at the same time
    * system-to-system parallelism and inner system parallelism
  * At least one that is ill-suited for parallelism
    * Ask if Yehia knows about any simple example of non-parallelizable program
  * Others?
* Go through issues in `Postponed`
  * Five issues evaluated, most were closed and deemed unnecessary 
* Go through and refine (if necessary) issues in `Backlog`
* Discuss suggested issues from `New`
  * Potentially create some new issues
  * 19 issues evaluated and fleshed out so everyone was on board regarding their importance
* Prioritize backlog
  * From now on we need to more carefully follow the prioritized order of the backlog
  * Time is running out, we are closer and closer to reach our final dates
* Present what has been done in MVP
  * Moved to Monday meeting

## Decisions
* 

## Next meeting

**2023-03-27 | 08:00 | EG-3507**

* Present the MVP to get writing group up to speed
  * How the scheduler and workpool functions
  * How all the traits in `ecs` crate and queries work (how the macro works)
  * How Archetypes are implemented
  * How the profiler works and how to use it 
* Mail Yehia on Monday and ask:
  * Inform about the master-information event on Tuesday that makes us unavailable for our meeting, cancel that meeting (just for this week)
  * Send current draft of thesis and ask him to read and leave comments on:
    * Entire method (mostly done)
    * Results (Scheduler)
      * We haven't yet written about intra-system parallelization
  * Ask if he has any ideas for a non-parallelizable case study (because we can't come up with any simple ones)
