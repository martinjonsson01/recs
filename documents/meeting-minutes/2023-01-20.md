###### tags: `Meeting`
**13:00 | EG-3504**

Present: Martin, Mathias, Jacob, Linn, Edvin, Christoffer

## Before the meeting
* Everyone should have checked out and done some research on at least one of the topics written on the GitHub project board.
* Have booked a meeting with the supervisor, hopefully this meeting.
    * The meeting was canceled, moved to monday, time TBD

## Agenda
* Around the table
    * Mathias: Andra kurserna tar tid så får se hur mycket tid kandidaten kan ta just nu. 
    * Christoffer: Gått bra, gjort sin research
    * Edvin: haft lite mycket den här veckan, men de rullar på
    * Martin: Kämpar på men det är inte så mycket just nu, kommer vara borta den 10e februari fyi
    * Jacob: Krångligt att forska om applikationer av ECS, men det blir som det blir
    * Linn: mycket i LV1 denna gången, förbereder sig för skidresa med data
* Supervisor's wise words (If supervisor can attend)
    * Han är inte här så det blir bara dumma ord från oss istället
* Suggestion: move monday meetings to 08:00--09:45 instead
  * Ask supervisor if we can have the monday supervision meeting at a time that works for us
  * Vi testar måndagsmöten kl 8.10, ser hur det går
* Modifications to group contract:
  * Clarify who should update what document (we missed that part)
      * Timelog is individual
      * Project diary will be updated weekly, main responsible for it is Christoffer who makes sure that project diary is available for supervisor
  * You shouldn't be able to be assigned to multiple In-Progress issues at once
      * Not added to the contract, more a praxis for us to work by
* Present research results
    * Martin la in om Scheduling kort för hjälp
    * Martin hittade coola grejer om Rust som visar hur det passar vårt projekt
    * Mathias researched Amdahl's Law, found wikipedia which was a bit difficult to understand and some good videos
    * Christoffer researched downsides, hard to find anything concrete since ECS is a framework
    * Martin researched parts of an ECS engine, most sources were unfortunately only overviews in how to create an engine
    * Linn researched about ethics, found nothing directly related to ECS but went more into the game dev industry
    * We have a start for our gant chart to show our planned scheduling for the project
        * Some questions about how presentations are divided between us
        * Need to book timeslots for peer review etc
        * Booked Fackspråks Handledning 1 on the 28th of february at 10.30
    * Edvin researched the history of ECS, found that while the name ECS is pretty new the practice is older and was probably used by games on the Nintendo 64 game console
    * Jacob researched applications of ECS, the biggest being game development but also physics simulations and military applications, as well as possible future applications
        * the military application can be an ethical point
* Divide up work of writing project plan
    * Divide the work into issues, see GitHub project for distribution
    * We split the larger parts into smaller issues, i.e. the background becomes issues of history, applications and pros and cons etc

## Decisions
* Issues taken on today are not due to next friday, but there should be a first draft on every part. 
* Give supervisor new times for meeting, hopefully 8.10, otherwise 15.00 if possible

## Next meeting

**2023-01-23 | 15:00 | ??**
* Everyone should have a nice week end!
