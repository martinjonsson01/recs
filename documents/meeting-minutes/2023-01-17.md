* Begin researching

## Decisions
* See group contract.
* Issues have been created in the project board on GitHub. Each issue is a research subject, where you assign it to yourself and then take notes on the research you make inside this [Research](/f7fgOSU3TlyD5KP8b4_77w) document. Once you're done researching an issue, place it in 'In Review', and then we'll present what we've found on friday.
* Use threads on Slack, to make it easier to find relevant information.
* We will use Rust for the implementation.
