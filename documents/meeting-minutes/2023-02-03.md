###### tags: `Meeting`
**13:00 | EG-3508**

Present: Mathias, Jacob, Christoffer, Martin, Edvin, Linn

## Before the meeting
* Entire project plan should be written as a first draft
* Begin thinking of suggestions for paper title (leave as comments)
* Everyone should read through the project plan at least once, having left comments

## Agenda
* Around the table
    * Linn: taggad på ATB ikväll
    * Jacob: mycket i veckan
    * Mathias: återhämtar sig till helgen
    * Christoffer: de är gött
    * Martin: vi prioriterar bort sömn, punkt
    * Edvin: bara bra
* Go through all remaining comments in project plan
    * done and dusted
* Discuss project purpose, why are we creating an ECS-engine? What will we learn from it?
  * Suggestion: work backwards, imagine we have a **concurrent and cache-optimized ECS engine**.
  * What could be a reason for creating such an ECS-engine?
    * (Why ECS?)
        * To create real-time interactive games or simulations.
    * (Why multi-threaded?)
        * To better utilize available hardware.
        * Games do not utilize the avaible hardware.
    * (Why automate scheduling)
        * look at what others have done
  * What problems do we need to solve to create an ECS-engine?
    * Entities
	* Components
	* Systems
	* Scheduling
	* Querying
	* Memory layout
	* N-body, what problems can we verify?
	    * concurrency? 
  * How have these problems been solved in the past?
    * Found in research.
  * How is our solution unique or different?
    * ECS from the ground up.

* Revamp schedule with milestones and parallelism
  * iterations of scheduler
      * 1. run systems in sequence - implement in prototype
      * 2. run independent systems concurrently
      * 3. solve read write problem
* We should begin prototyping ASAP
  * It's almost been half of LP3 already, just spent on planning
  * Next week? Concurrently with final touches of project plan
* Mail Yehia first draft of project plan

## Decisions
* Next Monday we will plan how the prototyping will go.
* The Friday meeting will probably be rescheduled to Thursday afternoon (either 13 or 15), but this will be decided precisely on Monday.

## Next meeting
