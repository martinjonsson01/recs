# 2023-03-21 Half-time meeting minutes
###### tags: `Meeting`, `Template`
**09:00 | Zoom**

Present: Yehia, Martin, Mathias, Jacob, Christoffer, Linn, Edvin

## Notes
* New weekly meeting time is Tuesdays 09:00
* Always send a message about if the meeting will occur or not
* Using a dependency graph is not appropriate for this task because it is supposed to be used to break down a large task into smaller tasks.
  * Sounds like dependency graph is the wrong term to be used.
  * Example: Quick sort 
* Write about how the algorithm works.
* System Execution Validation through testing, not verification. Use validation not correctness.
* Suggestion from Yehia: Set up fair verification suits for different ECS engines.
* Could you compare and get these statistics from other implementations?  
* Two other case studies: one with high degree of concurrency, and another that does not allow us a high degree of concurrency. This will show when the engine is useful.

## Questions
* Can we use the Chalmers logo exclusively 
* Order of Result and Discussion, we will have results for both Prototypes and the final ECS?
