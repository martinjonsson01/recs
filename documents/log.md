# Project Diary

> The diary should describe in chronological order the phases of work in the project work, joint
and individual work in various tasks performed, problems that have arisen, suggestions of
various solutions and reflections about them and any solution implemented. Other
information that can be included is meetings, weekly planning, sub-objectives, etc. The diary
should be kept relatively continuously and the activities for a particular week have to be
